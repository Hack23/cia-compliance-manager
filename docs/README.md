## Business Overview

The CIA Compliance Manager is a comprehensive solution designed to help organizations manage and maintain compliance with various security frameworks and standards. The system focuses on the three core principles of information security:

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access
- **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data throughout its lifecycle
- **Availability**: Ensuring that information and systems are available when needed

## Architecture Overview

The CIA Compliance Manager is built with a modular architecture that consists of:

1. **Core Engine** - Manages the compliance workflow, assessment processes, and reporting
2. **Framework Adapters** - Pluggable modules for different compliance frameworks (NIST, ISO, SOC2, etc.)
3. **Integration Layer** - Connects with existing security tools, SIEM systems, and data sources
4. **Reporting Module** - Generates compliance reports, dashboards, and gap analyses
5. **API Layer** - Provides programmatic access to all functionality

For detailed architecture diagrams and documentation, see the [Architecture section](./documentation.html#architecture) in our Documentation Portal.

- **Audit Logging** - Comprehensive logging of all system activities
- **Data Encryption** - All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Secure Development** - Built following secure coding practices and regular security testing
