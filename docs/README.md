## Business Overview

The CIA Compliance Manager is a comprehensive solution designed to help organizations manage and maintain compliance with various security frameworks and standards. The system focuses on the three core principles of information security:

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access
- **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data throughout its lifecycle
- **Availability**: Ensuring that information and systems are available when needed

## Architecture Overview

The CIA Compliance Manager is built with a modular React-based architecture that consists of:

1. **React Component Library and State Management** - Manages the assessment workflow, security state, and interface rendering
2. **Security Framework References and Constants** - Configuration for different compliance frameworks (NIST, ISO, SOC2, etc.)
3. **Dashboard Visualization Components** - Generates compliance visualizations, dashboards, and gap analyses
4. **TypeScript Type System and Interfaces** - Provides type-safe access to all functionality

For detailed architecture diagrams and documentation, see the [Architecture section](https://hack23.github.io/cia-compliance-manager/documentation.html#architecture) in our Documentation Portal. The project also includes [future architecture plans](https://hack23.github.io/cia-compliance-manager/architecture/FUTURE_ARCHITECTURE.md) outlining the roadmap for upcoming enhancements.

## Security Features

The application itself is built with security as a priority:

- **Role-Based Access Control** - Granular permissions for different user roles
- **Audit Logging** - Comprehensive logging of all system activities
- **Data Encryption** - All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Secure Development** - Built following secure coding practices and regular security testing

For comprehensive security documentation, visit the [Security Documentation](https://hack23.github.io/cia-compliance-manager/documentation.html#security) in our Documentation Portal.
