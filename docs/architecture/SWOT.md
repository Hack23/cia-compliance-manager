```

## Strengths (Internal Positive)

- **Comprehensive CIA Security Model**: Detailed security levels (None, Low, Moderate, High, Very High) with concrete technical implementations.
- **Business Impact Quantification**: Clear mapping between security investments and business outcomes.
- **Compliance Framework Mapping**: Strong alignment with industry standards (NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, NIST CSF 2.0).
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Well-structured, modular design with clear separation of concerns.
- **Extensive Documentation**: C4 diagrams, mindmaps, flowcharts and state diagrams for clear understanding.
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Both unit and E2E tests with resilient testing patterns.
- **Modern Technology Stack**: Uses current technologies (React 19, TypeScript 5, Vite 6) with strong typing.

## Weaknesses (Internal Negative)

- **Application Complexity**: Multiple interdependent components increase maintenance difficulty.
- **Performance Considerations**: Heavy calculations for security assessments may affect responsiveness.
- **Documentation Dependency**: Requires extensive documentation for users to understand security levels.
- **Offline Limitations**: Limited functionality when not connected to the internet.
- **Learning Curve**: Potentially steep learning curve for new users due to security domain complexity.
- **Single-User Focus**: No server-side component for multi-user collaboration on security assessments.

## Opportunities (External Positive)

- **Growing Cybersecurity Market**: Increased regulatory focus on security compliance creates demand.
- **Integration Potential**: Opportunities to integrate with other security and governance tools.
- **Framework Expansion**: Addition of more compliance frameworks to expand applicability.
- **SaaS Model Development**: Cloud-hosted version could create recurring revenue.
- **AI-Enhanced Recommendations**: Implementing AI for more sophisticated security control recommendations.
- **Mobile Capabilities**: Development of companion mobile apps for monitoring security status.

## Threats (External Negative)

- **Evolving Security Landscape**: Rapid changes in security threats requiring frequent updates.
- **Competitive Products**: Other security assessment tools competing in the same space.
- **Regulatory Changes**: Updates to compliance standards requiring significant rework.
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Security issues in third-party dependencies.
- **Technical Debt**: Challenge of maintaining the complex codebase over time.
- **Assessment Accuracy Risks**: Potential for inaccurate security assessments leading to misguided decisions.
