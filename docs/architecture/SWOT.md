```

### Key Architecture Strengths

1. **Modular Widget Architecture**
   - Clear separation of concerns between widgets
   - Widgets can be independently developed and tested
   - Flexible UI composition for different use cases

2. **Centralized Security Level Control**
   - Security Level Widget acts as central configuration point
   - Changes propagate consistently to all dependent widgets
   - Provides clear security level visualization

3. **Service-Based Design**
   - Business logic encapsulated in service classes
   - Services accessed through custom React hooks
   - Clear API boundaries between layers

4. **Robust Type System**
   - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and types
   - Type guards for runtime safety
   - Utility types for code reuse

5. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
   - Vitest for unit and component testing
   - Consistent mocking approach
   - Test IDs for reliable UI testing

## Weaknesses üîç

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Weaknesses))
    Data Management
      Static Data Files
      Limited Persistence
      No User Data Storage
    Layout Adjustments
      Fixed Widget Layout
      Limited Responsiveness
      Mobile Experience Limitations
    Configuration Options
      Limited User Configuration
      Fixed Security Metrics
      Predefined Risk Levels
    Integration Capabilities
      Limited External Integration
      No API for External Consumption
      No Authentication System
```

### Current Architectural Limitations

1. **Data Persistence**
   - Current implementation uses static data files
   - No database integration for saving user configurations
   - Limited history tracking for security assessments

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Some calculations may be redundant across components
   - Re-renders might occur when security levels change
   - Limited memoization in some components

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Some widgets may not render optimally on small screens
   - Complex visualizations need better mobile adaptations
   - Touch interactions not fully optimized

4. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Some utility functions lack comprehensive documentation
   - Runtime behavior documentation could be improved
   - Missing component interaction diagrams for some areas
