The mindmaps above provide three different perspectives on the CIA Compliance Manager:

1. **System Overview** - Shows the core components, security levels, and key features
2. **Technical Implementation** - Focuses on the technology stack and implementation details
3. **Business Value** - Illustrates how the system delivers value to stakeholders

These visualizations complement the C4 diagrams by providing a different way to understand the system's structure and purpose.
