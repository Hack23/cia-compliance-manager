## üìä Key Architecture Decisions

### Architecture Decision Records

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| ADR-001 | Widget-Based UI Architecture | Enables modular development and clear separation of concerns between different security assessment areas |
| ADR-002 | Static Data in TypeScript Files | Simplifies initial development and enables type safety without requiring a database |
| ADR-003 | Service Layer with Hooks | Provides clean API between UI components and business logic with React-idiomatic state management |
| ADR-004 | CIA Triad as Organizational Principle | Aligns with industry-standard security model and provides intuitive organization for security controls |
| ADR-005 | Multiple Views of Security (Technical, Business) | Addresses needs of different stakeholders, from technical implementers to business decision makers |

### Key Quality Attributes

| Quality Attribute | Support in Current Architecture |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Modularity | Achieved through widget-based organization and service layer |
| Maintainability | Supported by TypeScript typing, consistent patterns, and clear interfaces |
| Extensibility | Enabled by service abstractions and data provider pattern |
| Performance | Basic performance considerations with React best practices |
| Security | Security-focused design reflects security best practices in application itself |
| Usability | Widget-based UI with consistent styling and interaction patterns |

## Current Architecture Constraints

1. **Static Data Only**: The current implementation uses static TypeScript data files without database persistence
2. **Single-User Focus**: No multi-user or collaborative features are currently implemented  
3. **Client-Side Processing**: All processing occurs in the browser without server-side components
4. **Limited Customization**: Security metrics and frameworks are pre-defined without custom framework support
5. **No Authentication**: No user authentication or authorization system is currently implemented
