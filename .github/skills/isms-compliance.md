# 🛡️ ISMS Compliance Skill

## Strategic Principle

**Every code change must align with Hack23 AB's Information Security Management System (ISMS) and comply with relevant security frameworks.**

This skill ensures that all development activities comply with Hack23's ISMS policies, ISO 27001:2022 controls, NIST CSF 2.0, CIS Controls v8, and other applicable compliance frameworks.

## Compliance Rules

### 1. Secure Development Lifecycle (MANDATORY)

**RULE**: Security must be integrated at every SDLC phase.

**Phase Requirements**:

```
Planning Phase:
□ Threat modeling completed
□ Security requirements defined
□ Compliance requirements identified
□ Privacy impact assessment (if handling PII)

Design Phase:
□ Security architecture designed
□ Data protection mechanisms specified
□ Authentication/authorization design complete
□ Security controls mapped to threats

Development Phase:
□ Secure coding practices followed
□ Static code analysis (SAST) executed
□ Dependency vulnerability scanning
□ Code review with security focus

Testing Phase:
□ Security testing performed
□ Dynamic application security testing (DAST)
□ Penetration testing (critical systems)
□ Compliance verification

Deployment Phase:
□ Security configuration validated
□ Deployment checklist completed
□ Monitoring and logging configured
□ Incident response procedures updated

Maintenance Phase:
□ Vulnerability patching process active
□ Security monitoring ongoing
□ Regular security assessments
□ Continuous compliance validation
```

### 2. Vulnerability Management (MANDATORY)

**RULE**: All vulnerabilities must be identified, assessed, and remediated according to SLA.

**Severity Levels & SLA**:
```
Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0):  Remediate within 24 hours
High (CVSS 7.0-8.9):       Remediate within 7 days
Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9):     Remediate within 30 days
Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9):        Remediate within 90 days
```

**Process**:
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Vulnerability scanning integrated
// package.json scripts
{
  "scripts": {
    "audit": "npm audit --audit-level=moderate",
    "audit:fix": "npm audit fix",
    "audit:report": "npm audit --json > vulnerability-report.json"
  }
}

// .github/workflows/security-scan.yml
name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run npm audit
        run: npm audit --audit-level=high
      - name: Run Snyk test
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```

### 3. Code Review Standards (MANDATORY)

**RULE**: All code changes must be reviewed for security before merge.

**Security Review Checklist**:
```
Authentication & Authorization:
□ Proper authentication checks
□ Authorization enforcement
□ Session management secure
□ Password/token handling secure

Input Validation:
□ All inputs validated
□ Sanitization applied
□ Type checking enforced
□ Bounds checking implemented

Data Protection:
□ Sensitive data encrypted
□ Secure storage mechanisms
□ Data access controls
□ Secure data transmission

Error Handling:
□ No sensitive data in errors
□ Proper error logging
□ Graceful error recovery
□ User-friendly error messages

Dependencies:
□ No known vulnerabilities
□ Dependencies up-to-date
□ Licenses compatible
□ Supply chain security validated
```

### 4. Change Management (MANDATORY)

**RULE**: All changes must follow controlled change management process.

**Change Categories**:
```
Standard Changes:
- Pre-approved, low-risk changes
- Follow documented procedures
- Automated testing required
- Post-deployment verification

Normal Changes:
- Requires approval before implementation
- Risk assessment performed
- Rollback plan documented
- Testing in non-production environment

Emergency Changes:
- Critical security patches
- Abbreviated approval process
- Post-implementation review required
- Documentation updated
```

### 5. Access Control (MANDATORY)

**RULE**: Implement least privilege and need-to-know principles.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Role-based access control
enum Permission {
  READ_COMPLIANCE_DATA = 'compliance:read',
  WRITE_COMPLIANCE_DATA = 'compliance:write',
  DELETE_COMPLIANCE_DATA = 'compliance:delete',
  MANAGE_USERS = 'users:manage',
  VIEW_AUDIT_LOGS = 'audit:view',
}

interface Role {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly permissions: readonly Permission[];
}

const ROLES: Record<string, Role> = {
  viewer: {
    name: 'Viewer',
    permissions: [Permission.READ_COMPLIANCE_DATA],
  },
  editor: {
    name: 'Editor',
    permissions: [
      Permission.READ_COMPLIANCE_DATA,
      Permission.WRITE_COMPLIANCE_DATA,
    ],
  },
  admin: {
    name: 'Administrator',
    permissions: [
      Permission.READ_COMPLIANCE_DATA,
      Permission.WRITE_COMPLIANCE_DATA,
      Permission.DELETE_COMPLIANCE_DATA,
      Permission.MANAGE_USERS,
      Permission.VIEW_AUDIT_LOGS,
    ],
  },
} as const;

function hasPermission(user: User, permission: Permission): boolean {
  const role = ROLES[user.role];
  return role.permissions.includes(permission);
}
```

### 6. Logging & Monitoring (MANDATORY)

**RULE**: Security events must be logged for audit and incident response.

**Required Logging**:
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Comprehensive security logging
interface SecurityEvent {
  readonly timestamp: Date;
  readonly eventType: SecurityEventType;
  readonly severity: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  readonly userId?: string;
  readonly ipAddress?: string;
  readonly resource: string;
  readonly action: string;
  readonly result: 'success' | 'failure';
  readonly metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}

enum SecurityEventType {
  AUTHENTICATION_SUCCESS = 'auth:success',
  AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE = 'auth:failure',
  AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE = 'authz:failure',
  SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY = 'security:suspicious',
  DATA_ACCESS = 'data:access',
  DATA_MODIFICATION = 'data:modification',
  DATA_DELETION = 'data:deletion',
  CONFIGURATION_CHANGE = 'config:change',
  PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION = 'privilege:escalation',
}

// Log security events
function logSecurityEvent(event: SecurityEvent): void {
  logger.security(event.eventType, {
    timestamp: event.timestamp.toISOString(),
    severity: event.severity,
    userId: event.userId,
    resource: event.resource,
    action: event.action,
    result: event.result,
    metadata: event.metadata,
  });
  
  // Alert on critical events
  if (event.severity === 'critical') {
    alertSecurityTeam(event);
  }
}
```

## Quick Compliance Guide

**Before implementing authentication:**
→ Review ISO 27001 Control 8.5
→ Implement MFA support
→ Use secure credential storage
→ Log authentication events

**Before handling PII:**
→ Review GDPR requirements
→ Implement data minimization
→ Provide data subject rights
→ Document data flows

**Before adding dependencies:**
→ Run npm audit
→ Check license compatibility
→ Verify supply chain security
→ Document risk acceptance if needed

**Before deploying:**
→ Run security scans
→ Verify configuration security
→ Update documentation
→ Enable monitoring

## Remember

**Compliance is not a checkbox. It's a continuous commitment to security excellence.**

Every feature is a potential compliance requirement. Think frameworks, code controls.
