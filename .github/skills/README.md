## 🎯 How Skills Work

### Skills vs. Agents

| Aspect | Skills | Custom Agents |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Purpose** | Strategic principles & rules | Specialized task execution |
| **Scope** | Project-wide guidelines | Domain-specific expertise |
| **Format** | Rule-based best practices | Actionable agent instructions |
| **Application** | Referenced by agents & developers | Invoked directly for tasks |
| **Focus** | "What" and "Why" | "How" to implement |

**Example Flow:**
```
Developer wants to add authentication
↓
1. References "Security by Design" skill → Learns threat modeling required
2. References "ISMS Compliance" skill → Maps to ISO 27001 Control 8.5
3. References "Code Quality Excellence" skill → Checks for existing auth utilities
4. Invokes "@security-compliance-agent" → Implements with skill guidance
5. References "Testing Excellence" skill → Writes 100% coverage security tests
```

### Skills Hierarchy

```
Strategic Level (Skills)
↓
Tactical Level (Agents)
↓
Operational Level (Code)
```

Skills provide the strategic direction, agents implement tactically, and developers write the operational code—all in alignment.

### Agent-Skill Mapping

Which skills should each agent follow?

| Agent | Primary Skills | Supporting Skills |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| **TypeScript React Agent** | Code Quality Excellence, UI/UX Design System | Performance Optimization, Accessibility Excellence |
| **Testing Agent** | Testing Excellence | Code Quality Excellence, Accessibility Excellence |
| **Code Review Agent** | Code Quality Excellence, Security by Design | Performance Optimization, Accessibility Excellence, ISMS Compliance |
| **Documentation Agent** | Documentation Standards | Code Quality Excellence, UI/UX Design System |
| **Security Compliance Agent** | Security by Design, ISMS Compliance | Code Quality Excellence, Testing Excellence |
| **Product Task Agent** | Product Quality Analysis | All skills (holistic assessment) |

**All agents should be aware of all skills, but prioritize their primary skills.**

## 📖 Using Skills in Development

### For Developers

**Before Starting Work:**
1. Read relevant skill(s) for your task
2. Understand the mandatory rules (MUST)
3. Note the recommended practices (SHOULD, MAY)
4. Check examples and anti-patterns

**During Development:**
1. Reference skill rules as checklist
2. Ensure code aligns with principles
3. Document compliance in PR description

**Example PR Description:**
```markdown
## Changes
Implemented user authentication feature

## Skills Compliance

- ✅ **Code Quality Excellence**: Reused existing auth utilities, 90% coverage
- ✅ **ISMS Compliance**: Mapped to ISO 27001 Control 8.5
- ✅ **Testing Excellence**: 100% security path coverage
```

### For Custom Agents

Agents should **internalize and enforce** these skills. Each agent should reference relevant skills in their instructions.

**Example Agent Integration:**
```markdown
## Your Expertise
You are a security expert who:
- Enforces **Security by Design** skill principles
- Validates **ISMS Compliance** skill requirements
- Applies threat modeling before implementation
- Ensures code meets all MUST rules from skills
```

## 💡 Examples in Action

### Example 1: Implementing New Feature

**Task**: Add password reset functionality

**Skill Application**:

1. **Security by Design**:
   ```
   - Threat model: Password reset token hijacking, timing attacks
   - Controls: Secure token generation, rate limiting, token expiry
   - Tests: Security test for token validation
   ```

2. **Code Quality Excellence**:
   ```
   - Reuse: Existing email service, token utilities
   - Types: Explicit PasswordResetToken interface
   - Coverage: 90% including error cases
   ```

3. **ISMS Compliance**:
   ```
   - Framework: ISO 27001 Control 8.5 (Secure authentication)
   - Documentation: Update SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Audit: Log password reset attempts
   ```

4. **Testing Excellence**:
   ```
   - Unit tests: Token generation/validation
   - Integration: Email sending flow
   - E2E: Complete password reset workflow
   ```

### Example 2: Code Review Finding

**Finding**: Duplicate color utility function

**Skill Violation**: Code Quality Excellence - Reusability

**Resolution**:
```typescript
// ❌ Before: Duplicate code
function getSecurityLevelColor(level: string): string {
  switch (level) {
    case 'critical': return '#D32F2F';
    case 'high': return '#FF9800';
    default: return '#4CAF50';
  }
}

// ✅ After: Using existing utility
import { getColorForSecurityLevel } from '@/utils/colorUtils';

const color = getColorForSecurityLevel(securityLevel);
```

**PR Comment**:
```
Violates "Code Quality Excellence" skill - Section 1 (Code Reusability).
Please use existing `getColorForSecurityLevel()` from `src/utils/colorUtils.ts`.
This ensures consistency and reduces maintenance burden.
```
