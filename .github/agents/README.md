## How to Use Custom Agents

When working with GitHub Copilot, you can reference these agents in your prompts or interactions:

1. **Implicit Use**: Copilot may automatically select the appropriate agent based on context
2. **Explicit Reference**: Mention the agent by name or domain in your prompt
   - Example: "Using the Testing Agent, help me write tests for..."
   - Example: "As the Security Agent, review this code for vulnerabilities"

## Agent Guidelines

All agents follow these core project principles:

### Reusability First (MANDATORY)
- Always check existing code before creating new utilities, types, or components
- Extend existing code rather than duplicating
- Reference key reusable items in the codebase

### Release Priority (v1.0 Focus)
- Fix bugs in existing functionality
- Complete current widgets
- Stabilize existing features
- **DO NOT** add new features

### Quality Standards
- Strict TypeScript typing (no `any` types)
- 80% minimum test coverage
- Security-first approach
- Accessibility compliance

## Agent Configuration Format

Each agent configuration file follows this structure:

```yaml
name: Agent Name
description: Brief description of the agent's expertise

instructions: |
  Detailed instructions for the agent including:
  - Area of expertise
  - Project-specific guidelines
  - Best practices
  - When to use the agent
  - How to respond to requests
```

## Contributing to Agent Configurations

When updating or adding agents:

1. Follow the existing YAML structure
2. Ensure instructions are clear and actionable
3. Include project-specific guidelines
4. Reference relevant files and directories
5. Align with the v1.0 release priorities
6. Validate YAML syntax before committing

## Validation

To validate agent configuration files:

```bash
# Using js-yaml to validate a specific agent
npx js-yaml .github/agents/typescript-react-agent.yml

# Or validate all agents at once
for file in .github/agents/*.yml; do 
  echo "Validating $file..."
  npx js-yaml "$file" && echo "âœ“ Valid"
done

# Or use any YAML validator
```

All agent files must be valid YAML and follow the defined structure.
