  ## Security Focus Areas
  
  ### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization
  - Validate all user inputs
  - Sanitize data before rendering (prevent XSS)
  - Use proper encoding for different contexts
  - Implement allow-lists rather than deny-lists
  - Check data types and ranges
  
  ### 2. Authentication and Authorization
  - Implement proper access controls
  - Use secure session management
  - Follow principle of least privilege
  - Validate permissions on all operations
  - Implement proper logout and session expiry
  
  ### 3. Data Protection
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
  - Use secure storage mechanisms
  - Implement proper key management
  - Avoid storing sensitive data unnecessarily
  - Use HTTPS for all communications
  
  ### 4. Security Headers and Configuration
  - Set appropriate Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - Use X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
  - Implement X-Content-Type-Options
  - Set appropriate CORS policies
  - Use secure cookie attributes
  
  ### 5. Dependency Security
  - Keep dependencies up-to-date
  - Monitor for known vulnerabilities
  - Use security scanning tools
  - Audit third-party libraries
  - Minimize dependency footprint
  
  ### 6. Error Handling
  - Never expose sensitive information in errors
  - Log security events appropriately
  - Implement proper error boundaries
  - Provide user-friendly error messages
  - Monitor and alert on security exceptions
  
  ### 7. Code Security
  - Avoid eval() and similar dynamic code execution
  - Use safe APIs and avoid dangerous functions
  - Implement proper type checking
  - Prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, etc.)
  - Use parameterized queries/prepared statements
  
  ## CIA Triad Implementation
  
  ### Confidentiality
  - Implement proper access controls and authentication
  - Encrypt sensitive data
  - Use secure communication channels
  - Implement data classification
  - Control data access based on roles and permissions
  
  ### Integrity
  - Validate data integrity with checksums/hashes
  - Implement audit logging for critical operations
  - Use version control and change tracking
  - Prevent unauthorized modifications
  - Implement digital signatures where appropriate
  
  ### Availability
  - Implement proper error handling and recovery
  - Use rate limiting to prevent DoS
  - Implement health checks and monitoring
  - Design for resilience and fault tolerance
  - Plan for disaster recovery
  
  ## Compliance Framework Mapping

  - Program Management (PM)
  - Personnel Security (PS)
  - Risk Assessment (RA)
  - System and Services Acquisition (SA)
  - System and Communications Protection (SC)
  - System and Information Integrity (SI)
  
  ### NIST CSF 2.0

  ### ISO/IEC 27001:2022
  - Organizational controls
  - People controls
  - Physical controls
  - Technological controls
  
  ## Security Review Checklist
  
  ### For Code Changes
  1. **Input Validation**: Are all inputs validated?
  2. **Output Encoding**: Is data properly encoded for display?
  3. **Authentication**: Are authentication checks in place?
  4. **Authorization**: Are authorization checks correct?
  5. **Sensitive Data**: Is sensitive data properly protected?
  6. **Error Handling**: Do errors leak sensitive information?
  7. **Cryptography**: Is encryption used correctly?
  8. **Dependencies**: Are dependencies secure and up-to-date?
  9. **Logging**: Are security events logged appropriately?
  10. **Testing**: Are security controls tested?
  
  ### Common Vulnerabilities to Check
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Insecure Direct Object References
  - Security Misconfiguration
  - Sensitive Data Exposure
  - Broken Authentication
  - Broken Access Control
  - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
  - Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
  
  ## Security Constants and Utilities
  
  The project has security-related code in:
  - `src/constants/securityLevels.ts` - Security level definitions
  - `src/utils/securityLevelUtils.ts` - Security level utilities
  - `src/utils/riskUtils.ts` - Risk calculation utilities
  - `src/types/cia.ts` - CIA triad type definitions
  - `src/services/complianceService.ts` - Compliance framework mapping
  
  Always use these existing utilities rather than creating new security-related code.
  
  ## Best Practices
  
  ### Secure by Default
  - Default to most secure configuration
  - Require explicit opt-in for less secure options
  - Fail securely (fail closed, not open)
  - Use security linters and static analysis
  
  ### Defense in Depth
  - Implement multiple layers of security
  - Don't rely on a single security control
  - Validate at multiple points
  - Assume breach and limit blast radius
  
  ### Least Privilege
  - Grant minimum necessary permissions
  - Limit access scope and duration
  - Segregate duties where appropriate
  - Regularly review and revoke permissions
  
  ### Security Testing
  - Include security test cases
  - Test authentication and authorization
  - Test input validation
  - Test error handling
  - Perform security code reviews
  
  ## When Responding

  ## Release Context (v1.0 Focus)
  - Maintain existing security controls
  - Fix security vulnerabilities (critical priority)
  - Do not reduce security in the name of features
  - Ensure security tests pass
  - Keep security dependencies updated
