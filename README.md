## üè¢ Business Overview

The CIA Compliance Manager is a comprehensive solution designed to help organizations manage and maintain compliance with various security frameworks and standards. The system focuses on the three core principles of information security:

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access
- **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data throughout its lifecycle
- **Availability**: Ensuring that information and systems are available when needed

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The CIA Compliance Manager is built with a modular React-based architecture that consists of:

1. **React Component Library and State Management** - Manages the assessment workflow, security state, and interface rendering
2. **Security Framework References and Constants** - Configuration for different compliance frameworks (NIST, ISO, SOC2, etc.)
3. **Dashboard Visualization Components** - Generates compliance visualizations, dashboards, and gap analyses
4. **TypeScript Type System and Interfaces** - Provides type-safe access to all functionality

## Testing

The project implements comprehensive testing strategies to ensure reliability and quality:

### Unit Testing

The CIA Compliance Manager uses Vitest with React Testing Library for component testing. Our unit test approach follows these principles:

- Component isolation with mocked dependencies
- Constant-driven validation
- Test ID selection for reliable element selection
- Behavior verification focused on component functionality

For detailed information on unit test structure, categories, examples, and best practices, see our [Unit Test Plan](/workspaces/cia-compliance-manager/docs/UnitTestPlan.md).

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests are implemented using Cypress and follow these core principles:

- User-centric testing with focus on key user flows
- Constant-driven selection for reliable element targeting
- Resilient testing with fallbacks and retry mechanisms
- Comprehensive coverage of both UI components and integrated functionality

For more information about E2E test organization, custom commands, test patterns, and best practices, see our [E2E Test Plan](/workspaces/cia-compliance-manager/docs/E2ETestPlan.md).

### Performance Testing

The application includes a comprehensive performance testing framework to ensure optimal user experience:

- Measurement of key operations and interactions
- Performance baseline configuration
- Reporting and visualization tools

For detailed information on performance testing methodology and tools, see our [Performance Testing Documentation](/workspaces/cia-compliance-manager/docs/performance-testing.md).
