- **None**: No security controls implemented
- **Basic**: Minimal security controls to address common threats
- **Moderate**: Standard security controls suitable for most business applications
- **High**: Enhanced security controls for sensitive systems and data
- **Very High**: Maximum security controls for critical systems and highly sensitive data

Each level includes specific controls, technical requirements, and implementation considerations that align with industry standards and best practices.

### Compliance Framework Mapping

For detailed mapping of all security controls to industry-standard frameworks (NIST 800-53 Rev. 5, NIST CSF 2.0, and ISO/IEC 27001:2022), see the [Control Mapping Documentation](docs/control-mapping.md). This comprehensive reference helps organizations:

- Align implemented controls with regulatory requirements
- Demonstrate compliance during audits
- Identify control gaps for specific frameworks
- Understand how technical controls satisfy multiple compliance needs simultaneously

### Technical Considerations

- **Availability**: Understanding SPOFs and autoscaling is critical. Moving from Basic to High removes single points of failure and introduces real-time failover capabilities.
- **Integrity**: The jump from manual validation to blockchain dramatically increases data accuracy and ensures immutability, vital for industries dealing with transactional data.
- **Confidentiality**: Moving from public data to secret data introduces quantum-safe encryption, an emerging need for high-security industries to safeguard against quantum computing threats.

### Cost Management

The application helps organizations understand and plan security investments through two main cost categories:

#### CAPEX (Capital Expenditure)

One-time investment costs including:

- Initial software development and engineering
- Infrastructure setup and configuration
- System design and architecture planning
- Initial implementation and deployment
- Hardware purchases and installation
- Security tool acquisition

#### OPEX (Operational Expenditure)

Ongoing operational costs including:

- Maintenance and system administration
- Security monitoring and incident response
- Technical support and help desk services
- Recurring infrastructure costs (cloud, hosting, etc.)
- Updates, patches, and security upgrades
- Compliance auditing and reporting
- Staff training and awareness programs

### Cost Estimation Framework

To provide accurate and consistent cost estimates, the CIA Compliance Manager uses a standardized framework that considers:

1. **Baseline IT Budget**: All CAPEX and OPEX percentages are calculated against the organization's total IT budget
2. **Implementation Timeline**: Costs are spread over an implementation period (typically 1-3 years)
3. **Industry Factors**: Cost multipliers for specific industries based on regulatory requirements
4. **Organization Size**: Scaling factors that adjust estimates based on company size and complexity
5. **Existing Infrastructure**: Credits for existing security controls that can be leveraged

The application provides both aggregated and detailed views of cost estimates, allowing decision-makers to:

- Compare different security level combinations
- Identify cost drivers and optimization opportunities
- Create multi-year security investment roadmaps
- Justify security investments with specific business benefits

## Testing

The project implements comprehensive testing strategies to ensure reliability and quality:

### Unit Testing

The CIA Compliance Manager uses Vitest with React Testing Library for component testing. Our unit test approach follows these principles:

- Component isolation with mocked dependencies
- Constant-driven validation
- Test ID selection for reliable element selection
- Behavior verification focused on component functionality

For detailed information on unit test structure, categories, examples, and best practices, see our [Unit Test Plan](docs/UnitTestPlan.md).

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests are implemented using Cypress and follow these core principles:

- User-centric testing with focus on key user flows
- Constant-driven selection for reliable element targeting
- Resilient testing with fallbacks and retry mechanisms
- Comprehensive coverage of both UI components and integrated functionality

For more information about E2E test organization, custom commands, test patterns, and best practices, see our [E2E Test Plan](docs/E2ETestPlan.md).

### Performance Testing

The application includes a comprehensive performance testing framework to ensure optimal user experience:

- Measurement of key operations and interactions
- Performance baseline configuration
- Reporting and visualization tools

For detailed information on performance testing methodology and tools, see our [Performance Testing Documentation](docs/performance-testing.md).
