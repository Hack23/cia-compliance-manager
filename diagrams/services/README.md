# Application Services

This module provides services that implement core business logic and data access.

## Business Perspective
Services encapsulate the domain logic for compliance management and security
assessment, providing a reusable API for UI components.

## Architecture Perspective
The service layer follows a domain-driven design approach, separating business
logic from presentation concerns.

## Security Perspective
Services implement consistent security assessment logic and maintain the integrity
of security control recommendations across the application.
