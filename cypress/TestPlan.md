# CIA Compliance Manager Test Plan

## Testing Strategy Overview

The testing strategy follows a layered approach focusing on different aspects of the application:

1. **Smoke Tests**: Basic application functionality verification
2. **Core Behaviors**: Key user interactions
3. **Business Outcomes**: Tests focusing on business value features

## Test Categories

### 1. Smoke Tests

Basic tests to verify that the application loads and core functionality is available.

| Test            | Description                             | File                          |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Dashboard Loads | Verifies application loads successfully | `smoke/dashboard-loads.cy.ts` |

### 2. Core Behaviors

Tests that verify key user interactions and functionality.

| Test                 | Description                            | File                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Toggle Display Theme | Verifies theme switching functionality | `core-behaviors/toggle-display-theme.cy.ts` |
| Set Security Levels  | Tests setting CIA security levels      | `core-behaviors/set-security-levels.cy.ts`  |

### 3. Business Outcomes

Tests that focus on business value and key outcomes for users.

| Test                   | Description                     | File                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| View Compliance Status | Tests compliance status updates | `business-outcomes/view-compliance-status.cy.ts` |
| Review Security Impact | Tests impact analysis features  | `business-outcomes/review-security-impact.cy.ts` |
| Assess Security Costs  | Tests cost estimation features  | `business-outcomes/assess-security-costs.cy.ts`  |

## Test Execution Environment

### Local Development Environment

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Open Cypress UI for interactive testing
npm run cypress:open

# Run specific test category
npm run cypress:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/smoke/*.cy.ts"
```

### CI Environment

Cypress tests run automatically in GitHub Actions:

- On pull requests to main branch
- On pushes to main branch

## Test Data Strategy

- **App Constants**: UI text and security level values in `appConstantsHelper.ts`
- **Security Profiles**: Predefined security configurations in fixtures
- **Dynamic Data**: Generated during test execution when needed

## Test Reporting Mechanisms

### Local Reports

- Terminal output
- Videos in `cypress/videos`
- Screenshots in `cypress/screenshots` (on failure)

### CI Reports

- GitHub Actions artifacts:
  - Test videos
  - Screenshots of failures
  - JUnit report files

## Test Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Update Tests

- UI changes that affect selectors
- Business rule changes that affect expected outcomes
- New features that need test coverage

### Best Practices

1. **Use data-testid attributes** for stable selectors
2. **Isolate tests** for independent execution
3. **Group related assertions** within a single test case
4. **Follow AAA pattern**:
   - Arrange: Set up test data and conditions
   - Act: Perform the action being tested
   - Assert: Verify the expected outcome

### Selector Priority

Use selectors in this priority order:

1. `data-testid` attributes (most preferred)
2. ARIA roles with accessible names
3. Semantic HTML elements with accessible names
4. CSS classes with known stable patterns
5. Element hierarchy/structure (least preferred)

## Test Extension Plan

Priority areas for future test coverage:

1. **Accessibility Testing**: Verify WCAG compliance
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test on different viewport sizes
3. **Edge Cases**: Invalid inputs, boundary conditions
4. **Performance Metrics**: Load times, interaction responsiveness

## Continuous Improvement

The testing strategy will evolve with:

- Regular test coverage reviews
- Performance analysis of test execution
- Flaky test identification and stabilization
- Integration with code quality metrics
